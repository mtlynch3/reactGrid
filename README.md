# reactGrid
Starter code for Assignment 4

You should not clone this... it's not a full React app, just a few files

Run create-react-app on your own machine and modify App.js so it matches the code on this repository

Create a new folder /components within the /src folder and place the remaining files there

**src -> components -> Table.js TableRow.js TableCell.js
